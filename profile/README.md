### Applications

Whether you want to monitor your crops more efficiently, keep an eye on the water quality of lakes & rivers, define the biomass and carbon sequestration of a forest stand, monitor the dynamics of global biomes in the context of climate change, or inspect in detail solar panels on roofs, satellites and drones provide you with the necessary data.

VITO Remote Sensing translates these raw data into ready-to-use information and applications for companies, institutions and governments allowing them to gain insight through geo data.
